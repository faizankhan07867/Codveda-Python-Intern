# Codveda-Python-Intern
Roadmap for IT/CSE project 



Full step-by-step roadmap ‚Äî Prepare ‚Üí Publish ‚Üí Promote
Quick TL;DR

Prepare repo structure, README, license.

Add tests + CI (GitHub Actions).

Add docs, demo (GIF/video/PPT), and screenshots.

Tag release & create GitHub release.

Craft LinkedIn post (text + media) and publish.

Maintain: respond to PRs/issues, iterate.

Phase 0 ‚Äî Create the GitHub repo & initial push

From your local project root (where the files live):

# initialize if not already
git init
git add .
git commit -m "chore: initial commit ‚Äî Python Dev Task solutions (levels 1-3)"
git branch -M main

# create repo on GitHub (option A: CLI; option B: web)
# A) Using GitHub CLI (if installed)
gh repo create faizan/python-dev-tasks --public --source=. --remote=origin --push

# B) Or: create repo on github.com manually, then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/<yourusername>/python-dev-tasks.git
git push -u origin main


Suggested first releases: v0.1.0 (initial), v1.0.0 (stable/polished).

Phase 1 ‚Äî Repo structure & polish

Recommended structure (root):

README.md
LICENSE
CONTRIBUTING.md
CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
requirements.txt
level1/ level2/ level3/
mysite/
tests/
docs/ (optional)
.scripts/ (helper scripts)
.gitignore


Create .gitignore (Python + Django basics) or use GitHub template.

Add a LICENSE (MIT recommended). Example MIT header:

MIT License

Copyright (c) 2025 Faizan Khan

Permission is hereby granted...


Commit message examples:

feat: add N-Queens solver

fix: handle division by zero in calculator

docs: add README sections

Phase 2 ‚Äî README (the single most important file)

Make README instantly scannable. Use this template ‚Äî copy into README.md and edit specifics:

# Python Development Task List ‚Äî Faizan Khan

**TL;DR:** Collection of beginner ‚Üí advanced Python projects: CLI tools, scraper, API integration, encryption, N-Queens, and a Django auth demo.

## Live demo
- Django app: [link to demo if hosted]

Add badges (top of README) placeholders:
```md
![build](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/<you>/python-dev-tasks/ci.yml?branch=main)
![python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8%2B-3776AB)
![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/<you>/python-dev-tasks)

Phase 3 ‚Äî Tests & Continuous Integration (must-have)

Add tests (you already have some). Add GitHub Actions CI file .github/workflows/ci.yml:

name: CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python: [3.8, 3.10, 3.11]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python }}
      - name: Install deps
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          pip install pytest
      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest -q


Commit and push. After CI runs, copy the passing build badge to your README (shields URL contains your repo path).

Optional: add flake8 lint job and coverage upload (Codecov).

Phase 4 ‚Äî Documentation & Examples

Expand README with Usage examples: how to run each script, sample output.

Add docs/ or USAGE.md with step-by-step guides (Django runserver, encryption commands).

Create EXAMPLES/ or demo/ directory containing:

demo.sh (commands to reproduce demo)

screenshots/ (PNG)

demo.gif (short terminal run)

Python_Development_Task_List_Project_Faizan_Khan.pptx (you already have)

How to make a GIF from demo video:

# record demo.mp4 (e.g. with OBS)
ffmpeg -i demo.mp4 -vf "scale=640:-1:flags=lanczos,fps=10" -y demo.gif


Embed the GIF and PPT link in README so viewers can see the project quickly.

Phase 5 ‚Äî Docker & Easy Launch (optional but great for recruiters)

Add a Dockerfile (simple example for Django part):

FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
ENV DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=mysite.settings
CMD ["python", "mysite/manage.py", "runserver", "0.0.0.0:8000"]


Add docker-compose.yml if you want to run DB services.

Phase 6 ‚Äî Release prep & tagging

Decide version: use SemVer (v1.0.0 when feature-complete).

Tag and push:

git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0 ‚Äî polished project & docs"
git push origin v1.0.0


Open GitHub ‚Üí Releases ‚Üí Draft a release:

Title: v1.0.0

Describe: features, changelog, how to run.

Upload compiled assets (zip, pptx).

Phase 7 ‚Äî LinkedIn Launch ‚Äî exact steps & post templates
Pre-post checklist (do this BEFORE publishing)

‚úÖ README polished and badges showing passing CI

‚úÖ Demo GIF & short video (60‚Äì90s), PPT attached

‚úÖ Repository description on GitHub (1-line and topics/tags e.g. python, django, web-scraping)

‚úÖ Release created (v1.0.0) with assets

‚úÖ Tests passing on CI

Where to post on LinkedIn

Make a regular post (feed) + pin the repo in Featured on your profile.

Optionally: write a LinkedIn article (longer write-up) and link to repo.

What to attach in LinkedIn post

One hero image (screenshot or GIF) ‚Äî 1200√ó627 looks good.

Attach the PPTX as a file OR link to GitHub release or a YouTube demo.

Short CTA link to repo.

Sample LinkedIn posts

Short version (copy/paste):

I just published a complete Python project: Python Development Task List ‚Äî 10+ scripts (CLI, web scraper, API integration), encryption tools, and a Django auth demo.
‚ñ∂ Demo: [YouTube/Drive link] ‚Ä¢ üîó Repo: https://github.com/
<you>/python-dev-tasks
Feedback and ‚≠êÔ∏è are welcome! #Python #Django #OpenSource #FaizanKhan

Longer version (narrative + bullets):

After a few weekends of coding, I‚Äôm excited to share my latest project: Python Development Task List ‚Äî a structured set of exercises and working solutions to help beginners ‚Üí advanced learners.
Highlights:

Level 1: simple utilities (calculator, word counter)

Level 2: JSON-based to-do CLI, web scraper, CoinGecko API integration

Level 3: Fernet file encryption, N-Queens solver, Django authentication app
Demo (60s): [YouTube link] ‚Ä¢ Repo: https://github.com/
<you>/python-dev-tasks
I wrote tests, set up CI, and included a PPT demo. Open to PRs, ideas for extra tasks, or collaborations. üôå
#Python #OpenSource #Django #WebScraping #Crypto

Call to action (always):

‚ÄúTry it: clone, run pytest, open the demo, and let me know what you think.‚Äù

Ask a specific question for engagement: ‚ÄúWhich feature should I expand next?‚Äù

When to post

Best times vary per audience; generic good times: Tue‚ÄìThu mornings in your local timezone.

Post once; then 24‚Äì48 hours later, respond to comments, and post a follow-up with a short clip answering a question/comment.

Phase 8 ‚Äî Repo management after launch

Add Issue templates (.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md and feature_request.md).

Add PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md to guide contributors.

Add CONTRIBUTING.md describing workflow and code style.

Add labels (bug, enhancement, help wanted, good first issue).

Use Projects (Kanban) to track roadmap.

Simple PR template (.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md):

## What changed
- Summary of changes

## Why
- Reason/issue

## Tests
- [ ] Ran pytest
- [ ] Linted code

## Notes
- Additional notes for reviewers


Issue template example (.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md):

---
name: Feature request
about: Suggest an idea for this project
---

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**

**Describe the solution you'd like**

**Additional context**

Extra polish (helpful, not essential)

Add Makefile with commands: make run, make test, make format.

Add pre-commit config for black/flake8/isort. Add note in README.

Add code coverage badge (Codecov) and test coverage threshold.

Add GitHub Actions to auto-deploy a demo (if you host the Django app somewhere).

LinkedIn post checklist (final)

Before hitting Post:

 Repo URL in the post.

 Hero GIF as first image.

 Short video link attached or embedded.

 PPT attached (helps recruiters).

 2‚Äì4 relevant hashtags.

 Clear CTA (‚ÄúTry it, star it, give feedback‚Äù).

 Add repo to your LinkedIn Featured section after posting.

Extras: copy/paste templates (README start, CONTRIBUTING, MIT, CI, PR template)

(You already have a lot of files. If you want, I can auto-generate the missing ones for you ‚Äî CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, .github/workflows/ci.yml, ISSUE_TEMPLATEs, badges, and a polished README.md.)

Final suggestions & next moves (pick one)

I can generate all missing repo files and add them to a ZIP so you can drop them in and push.

I can produce 3 LinkedIn post variants and image thumbnails for you (including alt text).

I can generate a GIF from a short recorded terminal session if you upload demo.mp4.
